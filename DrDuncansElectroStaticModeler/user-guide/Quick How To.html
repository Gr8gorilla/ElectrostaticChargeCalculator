<h1>Quick Start Guide</h1><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: center;"><h2>System Setup</h2><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Make sure that you have JRE 7 installed from oracles website - <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre-7u3-download-1501631.html">Here</a></div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><h2>Using The Software</h2></div><ol><li>Choose
the number of charges that will be in the distribution you wish to
analyze. Enter into the box at the top of the screen, click enter
button.&nbsp;</li><li>Next you will enter the value of the charges in
Coulombs, there is a drop-down box that allows you to choose a metric
prefix for your charge strength, and the x,y locations of your
charges.&nbsp;</li><dl><dd><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">The
range of the graph defaults to -2.5 to 2.5, This range is a bounding
box inside of which you can examine the interactions of the charges.
The x,y location of your charges should be entered as they relate to
the origin of the bounding box.</span></dd></dl><li>When you confirm
the charges that you entered two graphs will be generated. The first
will be a 3d surface plot of the electric potential. The second tab
will be the 2d vector field that represents the electric field lines.</li><li>Plots can be exported. The 3d-Surface plot will be exported as a <span style="color: red;">.</span><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="background-color: white; color: red;">png</span>.</span> The Vector plot of the E-Field will be exported as <span style="color: red;"><span style="color: red;">.</span>svg</span>. &nbsp;</li><dl><dd><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: </span><span style="font-style: italic;">To
export the 3d-Surface plot you choose png from the file type list, to
export the vector plot you choose svg as the file type. If you do not
enter a file name, the chart will be given a default name.</span></dd></dl><li>To
change the range of your bounding box, click Options menu, Graph,
range/steps. In the window that opens you will see the current range
and steps and empty fields for entering new ones. Enter the new
range/steps that you wish to use, click Ok. If you leave a field blank
it will use the last value for that field. You will also get a warning
that you have entered some invalid data and that the field has been
reset to its original settings.&nbsp;</li><dl><dd><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Changing
the steps above 5 can give some strange results. This is likely a
result of how the points are generated. Feel free to experiment with
manipulating the range and steps. The larger your range, the farther
out the view will be. Sometimes setting the steps too large will result
in no graph at all being generated or sometimes a black square. This
will be worked on in future revisions.&nbsp;</span></dd></dl><li>The 3d surface plot can be viewed from different angles by left-clicking the graph and dragging with the mouse. The
2d vector plot can be zoomed with the mouse wheel. Zooming out beyond
the bounding box will show nothing as of right now, in the future this
will be edited to show the charge distribution as a point charge if the
distance away is great. </li></ol><dl style="text-align: center;"><dd>Java VM Concerns</dd></dl><ol><dl><dt>If
you are entering a large number of charges you should increase the
amount of memory allocated to the JVM. You can do this by opening
a command line and typing java -Xmx512m appName where 512 is how much
memory and m can be m or k for mega or kilo bytes. You can also use
java -Xms128m to set the minimum heap size. </dt></dl></ol></div><h2><a href="StartHere.html">Home</a></h2>
