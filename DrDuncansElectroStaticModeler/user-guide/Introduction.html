program is an attempt to create an accurate, cross-platform, free, open
source, model of the concepts of Electrostatics as learned in a Physics
course on Electricity and Magnetism. This software is in a beta stage.
Current capabilities include:<br><br></big><ul><li>Accept user entered static charge distribution. Charges are entered in Coulombs and x,y coordinates.</li><li>Produce a 3d surface plot of the entered charge distribution's electric potential or voltage.</li><li>Produce a 2d vector field representation of the charge distribuiton's electric field.&nbsp;</li><li>Save the 2d vector field as a SVG image.&nbsp;</li><li>Save the 3d surface plot in PNG format.&nbsp;</li><li>Calculate both the electric potential and electric force vector at any point within the charge distribution.</li></ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Planned additional features:<br><ul><li>Ability to save the user's entered data.</li><li>Ability to load charge data from external files such as csv.</li><li>Ability to export the 3d surface plot in SVG format.</li><li>Ability to interactively change the charge distribution with a mouse and change the image data in real time.</li></ul><div style="text-align: center;"><h2><br></h2><h2><br></h2><h2><a href="StartHere.html">Home </a><a href="StartHere.html">&nbsp;</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2></div></body></html>
